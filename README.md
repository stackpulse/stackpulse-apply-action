Github Action for applying automatic Incident Response playbooks and triggers with StackPulse.

This action allows you to apply the GitOps paradigm to managing your StackPulse Incident Response Playbooks (and triggers), implementing the continuous integration and delivery to your _operations-as-code_ processes.

## Configuration

In order to use this action you will need to have a [StackPulse](https://stackpulse.com) account and to create StackPulse API keys. For those who are already subscribed to [StackPulse](https://stackpulse.com), the process is explained in detail in the [documentation](https://docs.stackpulse.io/cli/#generating-api-key-and-secret-for-usage-with-stackpulse-cli).

After creating the API keys we recommend storing them as [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in your organization or repository in order to use this action.

> In the examples below StackPulse API client id and secret are stored as `SP_CLIENT_ID` and `SP_CLIENT_SECRET` accordingly.

* `yamlFile` [**Required**] - Path to the yaml file of the playbook or trigger to apply, only relative path allowed
